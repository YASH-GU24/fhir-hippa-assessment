# HIPAA Compliance and Security Architecture for FHIR NLP System

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive security and compliance strategy for the AI-powered FHIR healthcare data querying system. The architecture ensures HIPAA compliance while maintaining system usability and performance through industry-standard security practices, role-based access controls, and comprehensive audit logging.

## 1. Authentication & Authorization Framework

### 1.1 SMART on FHIR Integration

**OAuth 2.0 with PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange)**
- Implement OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow with PKCE for secure client authentication
- Support for both confidential and public clients (web apps, mobile apps, SPAs)
- Integration with SMART on FHIR specifications for healthcare-specific authorization

```
Authorization Flow:
1. Client redirects user to authorization server with PKCE challenge
2. User authenticates with healthcare organization's identity provider
3. Authorization server validates user credentials and requested scopes
4. Client receives authorization code and exchanges for access token
5. Access token includes FHIR resource scopes and patient context
```

**SMART Launch Framework**
- Support for EHR launch context (embedded within electronic health records)
- Standalone launch capability for independent applications
- Patient and practitioner launch contexts with appropriate scope restrictions

### 1.2 Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

**Required for All Healthcare Personnel**
- Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) using apps like Google Authenticator
- SMS-based authentication as fallback option
- Hardware security keys (FIDO2/WebAuthn) for high-privilege accounts
- Biometric authentication for mobile applications where available

### 1.3 Single Sign-On (SSO) Integration

**Enterprise Identity Provider Support**
- SAML 2.0 integration with healthcare organization's identity systems
- OpenID Connect (OIDC) for modern identity providers
- Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) compatibility
- Support for popular healthcare identity providers (Epic MyChart, Cerner, etc.)

## 2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Architecture

### 2.1 Healthcare Role Hierarchy

**Primary Roles:**
- **System Administrator**: Full system access, user management, audit review
- **Healthcare Administrator**: Patient data oversight, department management
- **Physician**: Full patient access within assigned departments/specialties
- **Nurse**: Patient care data access, limited administrative functions
- **Pharmacist**: Medication-related data access, drug interaction analysis
- **Researcher**: De-identified data access for approved studies
- **Auditor**: Read-only access to audit logs and compliance reports

### 2.2 Granular Permission Model

**Resource-Level Permissions:**
```
Patient Resources:
- patient:read (basic demographics)
- patient:read-sensitive (SSN, detailed address)
- patient:write (update patient information)

Condition Resources:
- condition:read (medical conditions)
- condition:write (add/update diagnoses)

Observation Resources:
- observation:read (vital signs, lab results)
- observation:read-sensitive (mental health, substance abuse)
```

**Contextual Access Controls:**
- Department-based restrictions (Cardiology, Oncology, Pediatrics)
- Patient relationship requirements (assigned provider, care team member)
- Time-based access controls (emergency override, scheduled access)
- Location-based restrictions (facility IP ranges, VPN requirements)

### 2.3 Dynamic Authorization

**Real-Time Access Decisions**
- Integration with Policy Decision Points (PDP) using XACML or OPA (Open Policy Agent)
- Context-aware authorization based on:
  - Current patient assignment
  - Emergency situations (break-glass access)
  - Shift schedules and on-call status
  - Geographical location and device trust level

## 3. Data Privacy and Protection Strategy

### 3.1 Data Classification and Handling

**PHI (Protected Health Information) Classification:**
- **Level 1 - Public**: De-identified statistical data
- **Level 2 - Internal**: Aggregated healthcare metrics
- **Level 3 - Confidential**: Identified patient data
- **Level 4 - Restricted**: Sensitive conditions (mental health, substance abuse, HIV)

### 3.2 Encryption Standards

**Data at Rest:**
- AES-256 encryption for all databases and file storage
- Separate encryption keys for different data classification levels
- Hardware Security Modules (HSM) for key management
- Regular key rotation (quarterly for PHI, annually for other data)

**Data in Transit:**
- TLS 1.3 for all client-server communications
- Mutual TLS (mTLS) for service-to-service communication
- Certificate pinning for mobile applications
- VPN requirements for remote access to sensitive systems

**Data in Use:**
- Confidential computing for sensitive data processing
- Homomorphic encryption for privacy-preserving analytics
- Secure enclaves for NLP processing of sensitive text

### 3.3 Data Minimization and Purpose Limitation

**Query Result Filtering:**
- Automatic filtering based on user role and current context
- Minimum necessary standard enforcement
- Dynamic data masking for non-authorized fields
- Configurable data retention policies per data type

**NLP Processing Privacy:**
- On-premises NLP models to prevent data leakage to third parties
- Differential privacy techniques for model training
- Automatic PHI detection and redaction in query logs
- Secure model inference without data persistence

## 4. Comprehensive Audit Logging Strategy
